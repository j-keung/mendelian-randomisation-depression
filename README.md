# mendelian-randomisation-depression

Significant variants were identified in a forthcoming Major Depressive Disorder GWAS conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. As the manuscript is not yet published, information on the fine-mapped variants have not been disclosed.

The significant variants were used to conduct a phenome-wide association study, Fisher's exact test and Mendelian Randomisation.

The scripts contain publicly available data from the following GWAS papers: <br>
